# password-generator
Generates a password of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.

Currently, it returns a generated password of random lowercase letters with a length of 8 characters. This will be improved to then have a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters; with the user being able to choose any number between 8 and 120 characters for their generated password to have.
